## test `aggreCAT::` output function 

This checks the `aggregate_cs` function works.

```{r}
test_file("tests/testthat/test-aggregate-cs.R")
```

## placeholder methods

Running this `context` identifies the functions that are putting out the TA2 formats for *unfinished* methods. This involves `NA` for confidence score and `0` for `n_experts`.

```{r}

# test_file("tests/testthat/test-identify-placeholder-methods.R")

```

## confidence scores in (0,1)

This `context` informs us which confidence scores are not a number between, but not equal to, 0 and 1.

Placeholder methods will be exposed here, too. 

```{r}
test_file("tests/testthat/test-cs.R")

```


## Compare with anca's methods

```{r compare anca}
test_file("tests/testthat/test-method-comparisons.R")
