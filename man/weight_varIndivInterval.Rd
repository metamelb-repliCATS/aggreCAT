\title{Weighting method: Variation in individualsâ€™ interval widths}
\usage{
weight_varIndivInterval(expert_judgements)
}
\arguments{
\item{expert_judgements}{A dataframe in the form of \link{data_ratings}}
}
\description{
Calculates weights based on the variability of interval widths
within individuals.
}
\details{
This function is used inside \link{IntervalWAgg} for aggregation types \code{"VarIndIntWAgg"}
and \code{"KitchSinkWAgg"}. It calculates the difference between individual's upper and
lower estimates, then calculates the variance in this interval across each individual's
claim assessments.
