#' Weighting method: Variation in individualsâ€™ interval widths
#'
#' @description
#' Calculates weights based on the variability of interval widths
#' within individuals.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is used inside [IntervalWAgg] for aggregation types `"VarIndIntWAgg"`
#' and `"KitchSinkWAgg"`. It calculates the difference between individual's upper and
#' lower estimates, then calculates the variance in this interval across each individual's
#' claim assessments.

#' @return A tibble in the form of the input `expert_judgements` argument with additional columns 
#' supplying the calculated weight for each row's observation.
