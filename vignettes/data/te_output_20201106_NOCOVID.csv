There is overwhelming evidence that Honesty-Humility predicts prosocial behavior across a vast variety of situations. In the present contribution, we cloud this rosy picture, examining a condition under which individuals high in Honesty-Humility reduce prosocial behavior. Specifically, we propose that under self-uncertainty, it is particularly those individuals high in Honesty-Humility who reduce trust in unknown others and become less prosocial. In 5 studies, we assessed Honesty-Humility, manipulated self-uncertainty, and measured interpersonal trust or trust in social institutions using behavioral or questionnaire measures. In Study 1, individuals high (vs. low) in Honesty-Humility showed higher levels of trust. This relation was mediated by their positive social expectations about the trustworthiness of others. Inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly in individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Studies 2-5). Making use of measuring the mediator (Studies 2 and 3) and applying a causal chain design (Studies 4a and 4b), it is shown that individuals high in Honesty-Humility reduced trust because self-uncertainty decreased positive social expectations about others. We end with an applied perspective, showing that Honesty-Humility is predictive of trust in social institutions (e.g., trust in the police; Study 5a), and that self-uncertainty undermined trust in the police especially for individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Study 5b). By these means, the present research shows that individuals high in Honesty-Humility are not unconditionally prosocial. Further implications for Honesty-Humility as well as for research on self-uncertainty and trust are discussed.","[Pfattheicher, Stefan] Ulm Univ, Dept Social Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Boehm, Robert] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Aachen, Germany","Pfattheicher, S (reprint author), Ulm Univ, Dept Social Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",stefan.pfattheicher@uni-ulm.de,NA,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,2018,114,1.0,10.1037/pspp0000144,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000419001200011,179-194,Pfattheicher,Stefan,JAN 2018,"Inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly inindividuals high in Honesty-Humility (Studies 2–5)","Inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly in individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Studies 2–5)",1,1106,(x1: 285.58 y1: 284.34) (x2: 297.54 y2: 298.00),"Specifically, the third hypothesisreads that under self-uncertainty, individuals high in Honesty-Humility shift toward distrust","Specifically, the third hypothesis reads that under self-uncertainty, individuals high in Honesty-Humility shift toward distrust",3,5145,(x1: 423.79 y1: 371.38) (x2: 419.19 y2: 397.77),"Using logistic regression analyses, trustwas regressed on Honesty-Humility, the experimental condition,as well as their interaction","Using logistic regression analyses, trust was regressed on Honesty-Humility, the experimental condition (inducement of self-uncertainty or control), as well as their interaction",6,4481,(x1: 397.54 y1: 486.50) (x2: 406.70 y2: 512.87),"Honesty-Humility  Condition .82 .31 .01 .44 | Third, an interaction between Honesty-Humility andthe experimental condition was found","An interaction between Honesty-Humility and the experimental condition was found (From Table 2: B = -0.82, p < 0.01, Odds ratio = 0.44)",6 | 7,4961 | 275,(x1: 48.00 y1: 639.34) (x2: 338.00 y2: 643.00) | (x1: 95.91 y1: 122.88) (x2: 184.15 y2: 138.00),225 US American individualsin Study 2,225 US American individuals in Study 2,6,1744,(x1: 179.47 y1: 406.81) (x2: 87.89 y2: 422.23),.44,odds ratio = 0.44,6,5004,(x1: 328.00 y1: 639.34) (x2: 338.00 y2: 643.00),.01,p < 0.01,6,4999,(x1: 266.44 y1: 638.78) (x2: 283.10 y2: 643.00),Stefan Pfattheicher,stefan.pfattheicher@uni-ulm.de,1,https://osf.io/5wqsg/files/osfstorage/5d42f1583ce9350018ee239d,https://osf.io/hcxdq/files/osfstorage/5d42ed23bcd6d900178d6068,https://osf.io/fuy6j/?view_only=a001d1beccf54551ad0b6dc0f7ad1943,https://osf.io/wv32f/,TRUE,TRUE,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,non-covid paper

Terror Management Theory, in parallel, postulates that mortality salience mobilizes these resources to suppress thoughts of death out of focal attention. Consequently, we predicted that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Two experiments corroborated this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that utilitarian responses to non-lethal harm conflicts were less frequent when participants were reminded of their mortality. Experiment 2 showed that the detrimental effect of mortality salience on utilitarian conflict judgments was comparable to that of an extreme concurrent cognitive load. These findings raise the question of whether private judgment and public debate about controversial moral issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, since these issues (e.g., assisted suicide) often involve matters of life and death.

Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this greenfeminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, genderidentity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors.","[Brough, Aaron R.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Mkt, 3555 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Wilkie, James E.

We argue that such intergroup biases may result from an interaction of basic cognitive processes and the structure of the information ecology. This cognitive-ecological model assumes that groups such as minorities and out-groups are often novel to a perceiver. At the level of cognition, novel groups are primarily associated with their unique attributes, that is, attributes that differentiate them from other groups. In the information ecology, however, unique attributes are likely to be negative. Thus, novel groups, and by proxy minorities and out-groups, tend to be associated with negative attributes, leading to an evaluative disadvantage.

Misinformation can be very difficult to correct and may have lasting effects even after it is discredited. One reason for this persistence is the manner in which people make causal inferences based on available information about a given event or outcome. As a result, false information may continue to influence beliefs and attitudes even after being debunked if it is not replaced by an alternate causal explanation. We test this hypothesis using an experimental paradigm adapted from the psychology literature on the continued influence effect and find that a causal explanation for an unexplained event is significantly more effective than a denial even when the denial is backed by unusually strong evidence.

Experiments 1-3 asked whether as patterns in language suggest a structural similarity between representations of spatial length and temporal duration is easier to access than one between length and other dimensions of experience, such as loudness. Adult participants were shown pairings of lines of different length with tones of different duration (Experiment 1) or tones of different loudness (Experiment 2). The length of the lines and duration or loudness of the tones was either positively or negatively correlated. Participants were better able to bind particular lengths and durations when they were positively correlated than when they were not, a pattern not observed for pairings of lengths and tone amplitudes, even after controlling for the presence of visual cues to duration in Experiment 1 (Experiment 3). This suggests that representations of length and duration may functionally overlap to a greater extent than representations of length and loudness. Experiments 4 and 5 asked whether experience with and mastery of words like long and short which can flexibly refer to both space and time itself creates this privileged relationship. Nine-month-old infants, like adults, were better able to bind representations of particular lengths and durations when these were positively correlated (Experiment 4), and failed to show this pattern for pairings of lengths and tone amplitudes (Experiment 5). We conclude that the functional overlap between representations of length and duration does not result from a metaphoric construction processes mediated by learning to flexibly use words such as long and short. We suggest instead that it may reflect an evolutionary recycling of spatial representations for more general purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of survey data from five continents shows that individuals who report recent crime victimization participate in politics more than comparable nonvictims. Rather than becoming withdrawn or disempowered, crime victims tend to become more engaged in civic and political life. The effect of crime victimization is roughly equivalent to an additional five to ten years of education, meaning that crime victimization ranks among the most influential predictors of political participation. Prior research has shown that exposure to violence during some civil wars can result in increased political participation, but this article demonstrates that the effect of victimization extends to peacetime, to nonviolent as well as violent crimes, and across most of the world. At the same time, however, crime victimization is sometimes associated with dissatisfaction with democracy and support for authoritarianism, vigilantism, and harsh policing tactics, especially in Latin America.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Bateson, R (reprint author), Yale Univ, 115 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",regina.bateson@yale.edu,NA,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,2012,106.0,3.0,10.1017/s0003055412000299,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000310753800006,570-587,Bateson,Regina,AUG 2012,Analysis of survey data fromfive continents shows that individuals who report recent crime victimization participate in politicsmore than comparable nonvictims.,Analysis of survey data from five continents shows that individuals who report recent crime victimization participate in politics more than comparable nonvictims.,1,249,(x1: 396.39 y1: 103.43) (x2: 264.91 y2: 130.09),I test the hy-pothesis that individuals who report recent crime vic-timization will be more politically active and engaged than their peers.,The study tests the claim that individuals who report recent crime victimization will be more politically active and engaged than their peers.,5,2822,(x1: 235.09 y1: 703.15) (x2: 384.54 y2: 524.75),"This article relies primarily on data from four re-gional barometer surveys | LAPOP/AmericasBarometer 2010 | reported crime victimization (Victim).

This research adds the role of sponsor-sponsee similarity to the discussion of fit. The authors argue that similarity interacts with fit when conditions evoke suspicion or disrupt typical inferences regarding sponsorship relationships. Interaction is particularly important when the sponsor seeks to develop its image by association with a cause, and is also of consequence for the cause in terms of its branding. Three studies test sponsorship effects with respect to blood donation and cancer prevention organizations. Results support the predicted moderated mediation model, showing that similarity between a corporate sponsor and a sponsored cause can interact with fit, influencing sponsorship evaluations directly and shaping attitudes and behavioral intentions toward constituents indirectly.

Through six studies, the authors find that when associated with a product, lower pitch in voice or music leads consumers to infer a larger product size. Furthermore, evidence shows that this pitch-size effect occurs through a process of visual mental imagery, which can be facilitated through stronger visualization cues delivered via auditory channels and reduced when size perceptions are assessed directly in the presence of visual product information.

Moreover, having a lengthy postwar history with mass immigration mediates this effect, while the potentially mobilizing effects of far-right parties on the relationship between concern about immigration and political distrust are somewhat limited.","[McLaren, Lauren M.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [McLaren, Lauren M.] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Study European Governance, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","McLaren, LM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",lauren.mclaren@nottingham.ac.uk,NA,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0043-8871,1086-3338,2012,64.0,2.0,10.1017/s0043887112000032,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000301964200001,199,McLaren,Lauren M.,APR 2012,"The findings indicate that even after controlling for other predictors of trust in the political system, concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community have an impact on trust in politics.","The findings indicate that even after controlling for other predictors of trust in the political system, concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community have an impact on trust in politics.",1,3911,(x1: 232.26 y1: 30.98) (x2: 188.25 y2: 37.64),proposition 1. individuals expressing most concern about the impact of immigration on the national community will be most distrusting of politi-cians and political institutions.,The study tests the claim that individuals expressing most concern about the impact of immigration on the national community will be most distrusting of politicians and political institutions (Proposition 1).,7,1626,(x1: 80.50 y1: 367.16) (x2: 187.34 y2: 394.86),"The analysis conducted in this article is based on the european Social Survey, rounds 1–4.41 The dependent variable, political distrust, is mea-sured  via  an  11-point  scale  presented  to  respondents  after  the  follow-ing statement: “using this card, please tell me on a score of 0–10 how much you personally trust each of the institutions i read out. 0 means you do not trust an institution at all, and 10 means you have complete trust.

A possible explanation is that people selectively behave in a generous manner toward their true friends, but not toward fair-weather friends. Social psychological studies have suggested that people use a partner's attentiveness toward them as a cue to distinguish these two types of friends. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that people would increase their intimacy with a partner who was attentive to them. This hypothesis was tested by disentangling the frequent confounding between a partner's attention and the benefits provided by the attentive partner in two scenario experiments (studies la and 1b) and three laboratory experiments (studies 2a to 2c). In study 1, a partner's attentiveness was manipulated independently of the benefit provided by the partner. In study 2, the partner's attention was experimentally dissociated from any potential benefit. These studies consistently showed that the participants increased their intimacy with a partner when they received attention from the partner. This result implies that models of the evolution of friendship must incorporate information exchange regarding the valuation of the relationship, as well as the exchange of fitness-related costs and benefits.

People high in openness to experience, for example, tend to be more creative and have broader general knowledge than people low in openness to experience. In the current study, we use a network science approach to examine if the organization of semantic memory differs between high and low groups of openness to experience. A sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 and Big Five Aspect Scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. Next, the sample was split into half to form high (n=258) and low (n=258) openness to experience groups. Semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. Our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group.

Studies 5-7 demonstrate that carefully prompting subjects to consider the long run incentives of profit can attenuate anti-profit beliefs, while prompting short run thinking does nothing relative to a control. Together, these results suggest that the default view of profits is zero-sum. While people readily grasp how profit can incentivize firms to engage in practices that harm others, they neglect how it can incentivize firms to engage in practices that benefit others. Accordingly, people's stereotypes of profit-seeking firms are excessively negative.

Method: Participants were 5,868 males from the Growing Up Today Study, a U.S. prospective cohort spanning ages 9-25 years. Generalized estimating equations were used to test sexual orientation differences in the development of muscularity concerns, weight gain attempts, and weight and shape concern. Results: Desire for bigger muscles increased slightly each year across adolescence (beta = .10, 95% C.I. = .09, .11) regardless of sexual orientation, but gay and bisexual participants reported greater desire for toned muscles than completely and mostly heterosexual males (beta = .39, 95% C.I. = .21, .57). Desire for toned muscles did not change with age. Attempts to gain weight increased threefold across adolescence, with up to 30% reporting weight gain attempts by age 16. Although underweight males (the smallest weight status class) were most likely to attempt to gain weight, most of the observed weight gain attempts were by healthy (69%) and overweight/obese (27%) males, suggesting that most attempts were medically. unnecessary and could lead to overweight. Sexual minority participants were 20% less likely to report weight gain attempts than completely heterosexual participants. Weight and shape concern increased with age, with gay and bisexual participants experiencing a significantly greater increase than heterosexual males. Conclusions: Sexual orientation modifies the development and expression of male weight and muscularity concerns. The findings have implications for early interventions for the prevention of obesity and eating disorder risk in heterosexual and sexual minority males.","[Calzo, Jerel P.; Corliss, Heather L.; Field, Alison E.; Austin, S.

However, relatively little is known about what greed is and does. This article reports on 5 studies that develop and test the 7-item Dispositional Greed Scale (DGS). Study 1 (including 4 separate samples from 2 different countries, total N = 6092) provides evidence for the construct and discriminant validity of the DGS in terms of positive correlations with maximization, self-interest, envy, materialism, and impulsiveness, and negative correlations with self-control and life satisfaction. Study 2 (N = 290) presents further evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendencies over and above materialism. Furthermore, the DGS predicts economic behavior: greedy people allocate more money to themselves in dictator games (Study 3, N = 300) and ultimatum games (Study 4, N = 603), and take more in a resource dilemma (Study 5, N = 305). These findings shed light on what greed is and does, how people differ in greed, and how greed can be measured. In addition, they show the importance of greed in economic behavior and provide directions for future studies.","[Seuntjens, Terri G.; Zeelenberg, Marcel; van de Ven, Niels; Breugelmans, Seger M.] Tilburg Univ, TIBER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Seuntjens, Terri G.; Zeelenberg, Marcel; van de Ven, Niels; Breugelmans, Seger M.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Social Psychol, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Breugelmans, Seger M.] Higher Sch Econ, Int Sci Educ Lab Sociocultural Res, Moscow, Russia","Seuntjens, TG (reprint author), Tilburg Univ, TIBER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",t.g.seuntjens@tilburguniversity.edu,National Research University Higher School of Economics; Stichting Weet Wat Je Besteedt,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,2015,108,6,10.1037/pspp0000031,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000354609100006,917-933,Seuntjens,Terri G.,JUN 2015,"Study 2 (N  290) presentsfurther evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendenciesover and above materialism.","Study 2 (N = 290) presents further evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendencies over and above materialism.",1,862,(x1: 372.19 y1: 247.84) (x2: 220.89 y2: 271.50),"We expectedgreed, and not materialism, to also predict desires for nonmaterialgoods such as food and sex","We expected greed, and not materialism, to also predict desires for nonmaterial goods such as food and sex",8,3036,(x1: 240.93 y1: 683.88) (x2: 147.97 y2: 710.00),Next we computed correlations and partial correlations betweengreed and materialism and the four behavioral inclinations,correlations and partial correlations were computed between greed and materialism and the four behavioral inclinations.,8,4234,(x1: 306.00 y1: 300.38) (x2: 515.51 y2: 315.50),"We can see that materialism was best at predicting the desire for amaterial good while dispositional greed better predicted the otherthree behavioral intentions | When I am eating a bag of chips, I don’t want to stop until the bag is finished. 2.89 1.21","We can see that the greed sub scale (DGS) significantly predicted desire for nonmaterial good (food).

Drawing on stereotyping theory, the author develops a framework that proposes that the impact of an employee's behavior depends on how the employee is categorized. When the employee is considered primarily as an exemplar of the brand's workforce, his or her behavior is generalized more strongly to the brand.

However, past research has focused on public goods of fixed and known value, for which the added value of the produced public good is obvious. Research has largely ignored public goods whose eventual value is uncertain at the time contribution decisions are made. Two studies explored the effects of outcome variance on individuals' contributions to a public good and their reasons for contributing. Contributions were negatively affected by loss prospects in the distribution of possible outcomes. Further, loss prospects directly discouraged contributions because of loss aversion, and indirectly discouraged contributions by fueling fears that others would not contribute. The negative effects of loss prospects were stronger when social uncertainty was low. Implications for social dilemma research and the effective management of collective action are discussed.

Comparing this model with human judgments provides constraints on possible algorithms that people might use to predict the future. In the experiments, we examine the effects of multiple observations, the effects of prior knowledge, and the difference between independent and dependent observations, using both descriptions and direct experience of prediction problems.

In other product categories, high-priced brands are consistently of high quality, but quality of low-priced brands varies widely. Three experiments demonstrate that such heteroscedasticity leads to more extreme price-based quality predictions. This finding suggests that quality inferences do not only stem from what consumers have learned about the average level of quality at different price points through exemplar memory or rule abstraction. Instead, quality predictions are also based on learning about the covariation between price and quality. That is, consumers inappropriately conflate the conditional mean of quality with the predictability of quality.

Recently, a link between fertility and anti-black race bias has also been documented, an effect that is argued to serve a sexual coercion avoidance function. Here we demonstrate that both effects can be operative toward the same male target depending on inter-individual differences in race perception of the target. Across two studies, we found that the intention to vote for Barack Obama in the months preceding the 2008 election increased as a function of conception risk across the menstrual cycle. In the second study, we found that the effect is greatest among women who perceived him as more white than black, whereas the opposite was true among women who perceived him as mostly black.

We examine the complementary puzzle of mutualism, in which actors can benefit each other simultaneously, and the psychology of coordination, which ensures such benefits. Coordination is facilitated by common knowledge: the recursive belief state in which A knows X, B knows X, A knows that B knows X, B knows that A knows X, ad infinitum. We test whether people are sensitive to common knowledge when deciding whether to engage in risky coordination. Participants decided between working alone for a certain profit and working together for a. potentially higher profit that they would receive only if their partner made the same choice. Results showed that more participants attempted risky coordination when they and their prospective partner had common knowledge of the payoffs (broadcast over a loudspeaker) than when they had only shared knowledge (conveyed to both by a messenger) or private knowledge (revealed to each partner separately). These results support the hypothesis that people represent common knowledge as a distinct cognitive category that licenses them to coordinate with others for mutual gain. We discuss how this hypothesis can provide a unified explanation for diverse phenomena in human social life, including recursive mentalizing, performative speech acts, public protests, hypocrisy, and self-conscious emotional expressions.","[Thomas, Kyle A.; DeScioli, Peter; Haque, Omar Sultan; Pinker, Steven] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [DeScioli, Peter] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Polit Sci, Stony Brook, NY USA","Thomas, KA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, William James Hall 964,33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kathomas@fas.harvard.edu,NA,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,2014,107,4,10.1037/a0037037,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000348334800006,657-676,Thomas,Kyle A.,OCT 2014,Results showed that more participants attempted risky coordination when they and theirprospective partner had common knowledge of the payoffs (broadcast over a loudspeaker) than whenthey had only shared knowledge (conveyed to both by a messenger) or private knowledge (revealed toeach partner separately).,Results showed that more participants attempted risky coordination when they and their prospective partner had common knowledge of the payoffs (broadcast over a loudspeaker) than when they had only shared knowledge (conveyed to both by a messenger) or private knowledge (revealed to each partner separately).,1,1023,(x1: 174.11 y1: 286.34) (x2: 208.06 y2: 320.00),"The game-theoretic analysis of coordinationsuggests the common knowledge recognition hypothesis: In coor-dination environments, people strategically differentiate betweenshared knowledge and common knowledge, working togethermore frequently when they have common knowledge of the pay-offs than when they have shared or private knowledge.","The game-theoretic analysis of coordination suggests the common knowledge recognition hypothesis: In coordination environments, people strategically differentiate between shared knowledge and common knowledge, working together more frequently when they have common knowledge of the pay-offs than when they have shared or private knowledge.",4,3724,(x1: 382.89 y1: 276.87) (x2: 509.15 y2: 335.99),The participants then made a decision to work alone or with thepartner and indicated the choice with the keyboard,Chi squared tests were used to calculate if the observed frequency of participant’s deciding to work with a partner differed significantly from the expected frequency under the null hypothesis across the predictor levels of shared knowledge.,7,519,(x1: 57.00 y1: 220.47) (x2: 228.35 y2: 235.81),These results are consistent with the common knowledge rec-ognition hypothesis: Participants were more likely to try to worktogether with common knowledge than with any other state ofknowledge. | All levels 63.70 276 .48,"These results are consistent with the common knowledge recognition hypothesis: Participants were more likely to try to work together with common knowledge than with any other state of knowledge.

This is especially problematic in developing countries, where most citizens do not engage in routine examinations due to limited economic resources. We study the roles of education and individual time preferences in asymptomatic disease detection and management. Using discrete choice models on a sample of 4209 hypertensive Indonesian adults surveyed between November 2007 and April 2008, we find that both education and individual time preferences play important roles. However, the effects are different for people in good health than they are for people in bad health. Education does not seem to matter for disease detection when respondents are in good general health, and its effects on disease management vary largely in magnitudes between these groups. In terms of disease detection, more educated respondents have a higher probability of being diagnosed, but only conditional on being in poor general health. Time preferences, on the other hand, matter for respondents in good general health, but the effect is not significant for those in bad health. More impatient respondents that are in good health have a higher probability of being under-diagnosed because they are more likely to forgo routine physicals. The findings point to two distinct channels through which education can affect health, and suggest that different types of policies need to be implemented, in order to reach the entire population. Traditional programs that stimulate education and improve the socio-economic status of individuals in developing countries are helpful, but they do not address the whole problem.

Focusing on 'emancipative values', two ecological effects are shown: (1) the prevalence of emancipative values lifts people's protest above the level that their own emancipative values suggest (elevator effect); (2) the prevalence of these values enhances the impact of people's own emancipative values on protest (amplifier effect). We conclude that examining values in models of protest (and possibly of other activities), not only as individual attributes but also as ecological properties, gives 'culture' its full weight in explaining behaviour.","[Welzel, Christian] Leuphana Univ, Ctr Study Democracy, Luneburg, Germany; [Welzel, Christian] Higher Sch Econ, Lab Comparat Social Res, St Petersburg, Russia; [Deutsch, Franziska] Jacobs Univ, Sch Human & Social Sci, Bremen, Germany","Welzel, C (reprint author), Leuphana Univ, Ctr Study Democracy, Luneburg, Germany.",cwelzel@gmail.com,NA,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0007-1234,1469-2112,2012,42.0,2,10.1017/s0007123411000421,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000300885700010,465-479,Welzel,Christian,APR 2012,"Focusing on‘emancipative values’, two ecological effects are shown: (1) the prevalence of emancipative values liftspeople’s protest above the level that their own emancipative values suggest (elevator effect); (2) theprevalence of these values enhances the impact of people’s own emancipative values on protest (amplifiereffect).","Focusing on ‘emancipative values’, two ecological effects are shown: (1) the prevalence of emancipative values lifts people’s protest above the level that their own emancipative values suggest (elevator effect); (2) the prevalence of these values enhances the impact of people’s own emancipative values on protest (amplifier effect).",1,592,(x1: 400.88 y1: 198.32) (x2: 100.87 y2: 242.08),"In short, we expect that moreprevalent emancipative values (1) elevate an entire society’s protest level",The study tests the claim that more prevalent emancipative values elevate an entire society’s protest level.,4,136,(x1: 312.83 y1: 72.23) (x2: 382.92 y2: 88.78),"This average yields a more fine-grained 0–1.0 index.

However, as predicted by system justification or cultural learning perspectives, outgroup favoritism among non dominant groups is occasionally observed, particularly implicitly. The present research found that non-dominant group members displayed simultaneous ingroup and dominant group implicit favoritism. On indirect measures focusing on positive valence, members of non-dominant racial (Studies 1 and 4), religious (Study 2), and sexual (Study 3) groups showed ingroup favoritism. On indirect measures focusing on negative valence, members of non-dominant groups showed diminished ingroup favoritism, and sometimes favoritism towards the culturally dominant group. These results may indicate that positive self-regard forms associations between the ingroup and positive, whereas cultural learning and system justification form associations between non-dominant groups and negative. A cross-cultural design (Study 5) also found results compatible with these assumptions.","[Axt, Jordan R.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Moran, Tal; Bar-Anan, Yoav] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel","Axt, JR (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Box 400400, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",jaxt@virginia.edu,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0022-1031,1096-0465,2018,79,NA,10.1016/j.jesp.2018.08.007,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000448093100026,275-289,Axt,Jordan R.,NOV 2018,"On indirect measuresfocusing on positive valence, members of non-dominant racial | groups showed ingroup favoritism.","On indirect measures focusing on positive valence, members of non-dominant racial groups showed ingroup favoritism.",1 | 1,891 | 1032,(x1: 489.77 y1: 299.62) (x2: 400.51 y2: 312.66) | (x1: 235.90 y1: 318.78) (x2: 348.27 y2: 322.24),"If positive information about the ingroup induces ingroup favoritismon measures of positive valence, both members of dominant and non-dominant social groups should show ingroup favoritism on measuresthat are more sensitive to positive information.","If positive information about the ingroup induces ingroup favoritism on measures of positive valence, both members of dominant and non-dominant social groups should, on average, show ingroup favoritism on measures that are more sensitive to positive information.",3,3598,(x1: 50.06 y1: 636.61) (x2: 204.41 y2: 671.81),Explicit attitudes were scored such that more positive scores in-dicate greater preferences for the dominant group | tested for diﬀerences between good-focal andbad-focal MC-IATs using a series of independent samples t-tests,tested for differences between good-focal and bad-focal multi-category implicit association tests (MC-IATs) using a series of independent samples t-tests,4 | 4,2682 | 3532,(x1: 50.06 y1: 512.68) (x2: 216.93 y2: 526.96) | (x1: 124.61 y1: 683.21) (x2: 259.13 y2: 697.55),"White-Black associations 856 751 −0.12 (0.60) 0.16 (0.64) 9.01 < .001 0.45 [0.35, 0.55]","MC-IAT White-Black associations among black participants: good N = 856, bad N = 751, Good-focal =  −0.12 (0.60), Bad-focal =  0.16 (0.64), t =  9.01,  p < .001, d [95% CI] = 0.45 [0.35, 0.55]",5,2684,(x1: 49.95 y1: 179.36) (x2: 551.65 y2: 182.44),"we included 23,764 Americans | We classified partici-pants as White (n = 15,673), Black (n = 2064), or East Asian (n = 890)if they reported that race, and reported their ethnicity as not Hispanic,and classified as Hispanic (n = 2320) if they reported their ethnicity asHispanic | In Study 1, we excluded the MC-IAT data of participants (3.2%) whohad > 10% of their responses faster than 300 ms","We classified participants as White (n = 15,673), Black (n = 2064), or East Asian (n = 890) if they reported that race, and reported their ethnicity as not Hispanic, and classified as Hispanic (n = 2320) if they reported their ethnicity as Hispanic",3 | 3 | 4,5849,(x1: 426.90 y1: 356.72) (x2: 557.61 y2: 360.57) | (x1: 479.57 y1: 367.15) (x2: 337.24 y2: 412.84) | (x1: 50.06 y1: 458.77) (x2: 211.41 y2: 473.10),"0.45 [0.35, 0.55]",d = 0.45,5,2754,(x1: 502.59 y1: 179.36) (x2: 551.65 y2: 182.44),< .001,p < 0.001,5,2747,(x1: 452.81 y1: 179.36) (x2: 472.99 y2: 182.44),Jordan R.

The study was conducted at two points of time, Time 1 (2664 participants) and Time 2 (1492 participants), over approximately 4 years, controlling for gender, age, education, and having a chronic disease. Body weight was assessed by body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and the five-factor model by Saucier's Mini-Markers. Cross-sectional regression results indicated that conscientiousness was negatively associated with the three body weight measures, whereas neuroticism and extraversion were positively associated with the three body weight measures. The longitudinal regression results indicate that extraversion was associated with an increase in two of the body weight measures. Neuroticism was associated with increase in all three body weight measures and more strongly for women than for men. Openness was associated with a decrease in all three body weight measures for women, but this association was not significant for men. These findings help identify personality traits that lead to risk of weight gain and point to the modifying role of gender.

Adjusted for reliability, the effects increased considerably, largely due to the low reliability of both types of environmental measures.

In particular, the relative width of a face [facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR)] has been suggested to be a reliable cue to aggressive behaviour, at least in men. Additionally, facial masculinity has been associated with perceptions of dominance, a close proxy of aggressiveness. In two studies, we assessed the robustness of this link using faces transformed along these vectors in men (Studies 1 and 2) and women (Study 2). Additionally, we examined whether individual differences in self-reported dominance of perceivers moderated this association in order to extend previous work indicating that own dominance affects perception of such behaviour in others. Results indicated that both male and female faces with increased fWHR and increased facial masculinity were perceived as more aggressive. However, we found no systematic evidence for moderating effects of self-reported dominance on the perception of aggression in others.

The relative education hypothesis posits that when college degrees are rare, individuals with more education have less competition to enter highly-skilled occupations. When college degrees are more common, there may not be enough highly-skilled jobs to go around; some college-educated workers lose out to others and are pushed into less-skilled jobs. Using new measurements of occupation-level verbal, quantitative, and analytic skills, this study tests the changing effect of education on skill utilization across 70 years of birth cohorts from 1971 to 2010, net of all other age, period, and cohort trends. Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and college-educated workers are at greater risk for underemployment in less cognitively demanding occupations. This raises questions about the sources of rising income inequality, skill utilization across the working life course, occupational sex segregation, and how returns to education have changed across different life domains.","[Horowitz, Jonathan] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 123 W Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA","Horowitz, J (reprint author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 123 W Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",jonathanhorowitzresearch@unc.edu,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [T32 HD007168, P2C HD050924]",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,2018,83.0,4.0,10.1177/0003122418785371,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000439348300006,771-801,Horowitz,Jonathan,AUG 2018,"Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and  college-educated  workers  are  at  greater  risk  for  underemployment  in  less  cognitively demanding occupations","Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and  college-educated  workers  are  at  greater  risk  for  underemployment  in  less  cognitively demanding occupations",1,2626,(x1: 163.27 y1: 290.71) (x2: 150.68 y2: 318.01),"First, we  would  expect  individuals  with  college degrees  to  work  in  less  cognitively  demand-ing jobs when more of their peers have gradu-ated  from  college | thus, although individuals with col-lege  experience  use  verbal  skills  more  than those  without  a  college  background  do,  this advantage  declines  as  the  proportion  of college-educated individuals increases","While individuals with college experience use verbal skills more than those without a college background do, this advantage declines as the proportion of college-educated individuals increases",6 | 15,3082 | 70,(x1: 413.65 y1: 284.40) (x2: 323.76 y2: 337.94) | (x1: 90.93 y1: 469.37) (x2: 205.84 y2: 522.91),"I develop  occupational  skill  ratings  using O*NET data alongside a measure of substan-tive  significance  to  interpret  the  effect  of education  on  skill  utilization  as  the  higher-education  system  expands.

In contrast, source memory for faces associated with a history of cheating (i.e., memory for the cheating context in which the face was encountered) was consistently better than source memory for other types of faces.

This logistic regression analysis of autism count data was conducted to examine differences in identification according to seven racial reporting categories. We calculated the probability of autism identification for each racial group and tested odds ratios for significant differences within each state and Washington, DC. We also compared odds of autism identification for each racial group in each state to the odds of identification for White students in California. Within-state analyses indicated minority students in most states continue to be identified at rates significantly lower than their White counterparts. Between-state analyses revealed White students and minority students in most states were underidentified compared to White students with autism in California.

Latent class analysis reveals three groups based on knowledge and attitudes about science, religiosity, and preferences for certain religious interpretations of the world. The traditional perspective (43 percent) is marked by a preference for religion compared to science; the modern perspective (36 percent) holds the opposite view. A third perspective, which we call post-secular (21 percent), views both science and religion favorably. However, when faced with competing accounts of events such as creation and evolution, post-seculars root their views in religion rather than in mainstream science. Regression models indicate that perspectives on science and religion do not simply mirror other denominational or ideological differences. Furthermore, religio-scientific perspectives shape attitudes about political issues where scientific and some religious communities diverge, including on abortion rights and stem cell research. Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. This suggests that public divisions related to science and religion are cultural and epistemological.
